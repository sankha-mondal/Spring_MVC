# Core Components of Spring MVC :
1. DispatcherServlet:
	- Spring's Front Controller implementation

2. Controller:
	- User created component for handling requests
	- Encapsulates navigation logic
	 - Delegates to the service objects for business logic
	- The default handler is a very sample Controller interface with method:
		ModelAndView handleRequest(request, response).

3. View:
	- Responsible for rendering output

4. ModelAndView:
	- Created by the Controller
	- Stores the Model data
	- Associates a View to the request
		Can be a physical View implementation or a logical View name
	- The ModelAndView class is simply a container by which the model may be transported to and exposed by the view.
		It is not the model itself

5. ViewResolver:
	- Used to map logical View names to actual View implementations

6. HandlerMapping
	- Strategy interface used by DispatcherServlet
	- for mapping incoming requests to individual Controllers
